# Vol-1   

This is a fun project created mainly for **practicing DevOps concepts, GitHub Actions, and collaboration on GitHub**.  
The idea is simple: everyone contributes a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù like program, but with a small twist in the message.  

By contributing, you‚Äôll get hands-on practice with:  
- Forking repositories  
- Cloning projects locally  
- Creating new files in the correct structure  
- Using Git to commit and push changes  
- Opening Pull Requests (PRs)  
- Triggering GitHub Actions workflows  

This way, contributors (beginners or experienced) can practice **DevOps workflows** in a playful and easy way.
